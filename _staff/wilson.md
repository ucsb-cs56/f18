bio: >
    I am an undergrad going on to my fourth year in CS. My minor is in Arts and Technology. This summer, I am doing my first internship with a startup downtown where I am porting an iOS app to Android. I hope to keep working on mobile apps in the future. I also have a very deep passion for cats of all sizes. My friend and I are trying to make a fun augmented reality app with cats. Personally, I think CS48 and CS56 were some of the most useful classes I have taken here. They prepared me the most for my internship now.
